      <h2>Web Developer | Civil Engineer | Entrepreneur</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>I finished my degree as a Civil Engineer in February 2018 and started travelling -
      5 months in caravan around Europe (11 caravans, 64 peoples form a AVEIT - university association ,
      18000km and more than 16 countries). I ended this trip in Australia where I fell in love with the specialty coffee industry and worked as a Barista while improving my English.
      I came back to Argentina in March 2020 because of the pandemic and launched my own coffee shop @caferia.cafe.
      In 2021 I had the opportunity to travel and move to Europe. My passion for specialty coffee traveled with me, and I have been working in different companies as a Barista.
      I have recently started a 9-week Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp at Le Wagon that I'm really enjoying. Every week, I feel more and more motivated and I'm looking forward to start my career as a Web Developer and why not, combine my passion for coffee with my new passion for coding.</p>
